This project is currently in progress as of July 2012.   I need to find access to a MAC Osx with XCode,  so I've had to put this on hold for a little bit until then. 


To run this code, I belive you can import the project into Xcode, via dragging and dropping. 

This is written in Objective C. 

Currently, this build can :

-Display all views correctly
-Smoothly go back and forth between views
-smoothly go through the flash cards that were already added (from JapanTimes Genki textbook) 

(in the application, the about me screen has more details)

Things to implement in future builds:
-allow user to add cards of their own.
-better title screen
-information keeping track of what cards the user has missed/flipped the most often, etc. 

-possibly consider adding audio clips with a correct pronunciation of the word to each card (if this is to go on the market).
