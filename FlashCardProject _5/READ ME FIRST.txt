This project is currently on hold as of July 2012.

Currently, this build can :

-Display all views correctly
-Smoothly go back and forth between views
-smoothly go through the flash cards that were already added (from JapanTimes Genki textbook) 

(in the application, the about me screen has more details)

Things to implement in future builds:
-allow user to add cards of their own.
-better title/ splash screen
-information keeping track of what cards the user has missed/flipped the most often, etc. 

-possibly consider adding audio clips with a correct pronunciation of the word to each card (if this is to go on the market).
